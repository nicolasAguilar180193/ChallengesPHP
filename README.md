# Hackerrank exercises

This is a small repository where I keep the code for solving some exercises on the Hackerrank page.

Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges

The exercises are saved in the source directory (src) and there is a directory for each exercise where there are two files, one for the description of the problem (Description.md) and the other where the resolution of the problem is located (Resolution .php) in this case in the PHP programming language.
